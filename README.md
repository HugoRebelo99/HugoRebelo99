### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! My name is Hugo Rebelo! ðŸ˜„

### ðŸŒ± **About me**
Since I was at a young age, I was always fascinated and curious about how computers work and how we could
improve our lives based on them. This curiosity drove me to continuously seek knowledge in this area.
This made me decide to graduate in Computer Engineering. Outside the working time, I also like to be aware of
other tools and frameworks that are currently being launched and used on a production environment.

### ðŸ’¼ **Experience**
Currently working as Build & CI/CD developer @ Critical TechWorks.
